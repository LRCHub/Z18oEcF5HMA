I might have to take my records now, I want them back
That never meant that much to you
You took my time, you took my books
I took your photograph
And now that's all I've left of you
Yeah, it's true

Now when you come around
You always bring me down
You laugh about the things you put me through
I don't care what you are going through
It's never gonna bring me back to you

'Cause of the things you left
You drag them back and back
I called you up and I read it back to you
All the things I'd heard before
They're true and so much more
Never expected it from you
Yeah, it's true
